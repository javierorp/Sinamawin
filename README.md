### üîç View the network adapters

All the information about the network adapters detected on your computer in one place and quick to view (status, MAC address, IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, preferred DNS server, alternate DNS server, prefix origin and suffix origin).

<img width="800" src="./images/view_adapters/view_adapters_01.png" alt="Main app screnn (view adapters)">

### üÜï New network adapter detected

The application scans the network adapters connected to the computer when the application is launched. If the information is to be refreshed, the "Refresh" option is available in "File" or by pressing Ctrl+R. If a new network adapter is detected it is highlighted.

<img width="800" src="./images/new_adapter/new_adapter_01.png" alt="New network adapter detected">

### üìã Copy/export all the relevant information

The information of a network adapter can be copied to the clipboard using the "Copy information" option under the "Select action" menu.

<img width="800" src="./images/copy_export/copy_export_01.png" alt="'Copy information' action">

The information available in the clipboard would be:

```Text
Index: 1
Name: Wi-Fi
Description: Wireless Network Adapter
Status: Up
MAC address: AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA
IP address: 192.168.1.250
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
Default gateway: 192.168.1.1
Prefix Origin: DHCP
Suffix Origin: DHCP
Preferred DNS Server: 8.8.8.8
Alternate DNS Server: 1.1.1.1
```

In addition, the information of all network adapters can be exported to CSV from the "Export CSV" option in "File".

<img width="800" src="./images/copy_export/copy_export_02.png" alt="Export information to CSV">

### üîå Enable/disable network adapters effortlessly

From the "Select action" menu a network adapter can be enabled or disabled.

<img width="800" src="./images/enable_disable/enable_disable_01.png" alt="Disable network adapter">

### üîÑ Change the configuration of the adapters easily

The main purpose of the application is to be able to quickly and easily change the configuration of network adapters instead of jumping between Windows menus. It is only necessary to enable the "Manual" option to modify the network adapter configuration and, when finished, click on "Apply changes" in the "Select action" menu.

<img width="800" src="./images/change_config/change_config_01.png" alt="Change and apply a new configuration on the network adapter">

A summary window will appear to confirm the changes.

<img width="350" src="./images/change_config/change_config_02.png" alt="Summary popup window with the new configuration">

### ‚öô Set DHCP for a network adapter without hassle

To enable the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) protocol on a network adapter it must be manually configured. When disabling the "Manual" option, a confirmation window to enable DHCP will appear. This will also cause the DNS servers to be automatically fetched.

<img width="400" src="./images/dhcp/dhcp_02.png" alt="Confirmation window to enable DHCP on a network adapter">

### üíæ Manage profiles to apply them later to the adapters

Different configurations (profiles) can be saved so that they can be quickly applied to the network adapters. In the "Select action" menu, the current configuration of an adapter can be saved for use on another adapter or at a later time.

<img width="800" src="./images/profiles/profiles_01.png" alt="Save profile">

A new popup window will appear to name the profile and modify it if necessary.

<img width="700" src="./images/profiles/profiles_02.png" alt="New profile window">

All stored profiles can be managed from "Profiles" in "Edit".

<img width="800" src="./images/profiles/profiles_03.png" alt="Access to manage profiles">

In the manage profiles popup window you can view all stored profiles, as well as add new ones and edit or delete an existing one. In addition, the option to import and export profiles in CSV is added. When importing a profile, if an existing name is detected, the imported profile will have the tag "_[number]" added to the name, thus preserving both.

<img width="550" src="./images/profiles/profiles_04.png" alt="Manage profiles window">

To apply a stored profile to an adapter, it must be done from the "Select action" menu and with the "Manual" option enabled.

<img width="800" src="./images/profiles/profiles_05.png" alt="Apply profile">

A popup window with the stored profiles will appear with two options: "Select" and "Select & Apply". The "Select" option copies the configuration to the network adapter, but without applying it, so that it can be modified. The "Select & Apply" option, on the other hand, applies the configuration, but requests confirmation before applying it.

<img width="550" src="./images/profiles/profiles_06.png" alt="Select profile">

### üî¨ ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

The ARP module, available in "Tools", allows consulting the current arp cache tables for an interface. If a IP destination address is specified, a ping is performed to that IP and the table is then obtained. In addition, if the IP is found in the arp tables, it is highlighted in green.

<img width="800" src="./images/arp/arp_01.png" alt="Access to ARP module">

<img width="550" src="./images/arp/arp_02.png" alt="ARP module">

### üëÅÔ∏è Nmap (Network Mapper)

To use this module it is necessary to install the [Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html#windows) tool in Windows. It is accessible under "Tools" and allows a simple and fast port scanning.

<img width="800" src="./images/nmap/nmap_01.png" alt="Access to Nmap module">

<img width="550" src="./images/nmap/nmap_02.png" alt="Nmap module">

### üëï Dress as you like

Everyone has a different style, so the application allows you to choose the theme that best suits you. The theme can be modified from "Preferences" in "Edit" and for the changes to take effect the application must be restarted. A list of all available themes can be found [here](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/themes/).
